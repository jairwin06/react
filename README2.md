# "React" Assignment

## Part II

Link to blog post that outlines my user testing experience and suggested updates to the website: http://www.juliasbetablog.com/bfl/user-testing-icm-website/

Because I'm working on an existing website, I'll be making changes to my forked version of the repository: https://github.com/jairwin06/icm.shiffman.net. What is the best workflow for sharing my work with you? I can link to my forked version of the repository (which should give a breakdown of all my edits) in the README for the assignment each week unless you would prefer a different workflow.
